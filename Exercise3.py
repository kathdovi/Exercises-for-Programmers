#Exercise 3: Printing Quotes

#Ask the user for the quote:
quote = input("What is the quote? ")
#Ask the user for the speaker:
speaker = input("Who said it? ")
#Print the user's input along with the structure, use \ when using the same quotes as in the print statement
print("%s says, \"%s\"" % (speaker, quote))
